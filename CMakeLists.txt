# Yea so I'm not even sure what the fuck it's doing.
# Installing this to your system doesn't even include the headers for some stupid reason
# and the dxc headers inside of the repo require some autogenerated includes, which, once again, are not installed
# so they're just stuck in the build directory doing fuck all. I don't know *why* it's like this, but I guess I'll just
# blame microsoft for not knowing how a unix system works.
